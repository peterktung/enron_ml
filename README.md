# Enron Dataset ML Project

### Note
All the analysis and models was done in the ipython notebook, and transferred into `poi_id.py`.  
While the parameter tuning algorithms were transferred to `poi_id.py`, the fitting of the models are commented out. The final classifier is created with the tuned parameters explicitly added, which was drawn from the analysis in the python notebook.
